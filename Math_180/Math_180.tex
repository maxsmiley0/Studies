\textbf{Isomorphism Algorithm for Planted Trees}

\textbf{K1: }Assign $01$ to each nonroot end vertex

\textbf{K2: }Let $v$ be the parent of $v_1, \dots, v_t$. If $A_i$ is the code of the child $v_i$, the code of vertex $v$ is $0A_1 \dots A_t1$

\textbf{Recovery: }Replace $0$ in the code with an up arrow, and $1$ with a down arrow. Then, write out the code, where up arrows generate a new vertex in the next level, and down arrows take us down to the previous vertex. 

\textbf{Isomorphism Algorithm for Rooted Trees}

\textbf{K1: }Assign $01$ to each nonroot end vertex

\textbf{K2: }Let $v$ be the parent of $v_1, \dots, v_t$. If $A_i$ is the code of the child $v_i$, the code of vertex $v$ is $0A_1 \dots A_t1$, where $A_1 \leq \dots \leq A_t$, where we are using the lexographical ordering

\emph{Lexographical ordering for binary strings is defined as followed: }
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{$A$ initial segment of $B \Rightarrow A < B$}
    \item \emph{$B$ initial segment of $A \Rightarrow B < A$}
    \item \emph{*else* let $j$ be the smallest index such that $a_j \neq b_j$}
    \item \emph{$a_j < b_j \Rightarrow A < B$}
    \item \emph{$b_j < a_j \Rightarrow B < A$}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Def: }let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph, with $v \in V$. The \emph{eccentricity} of $v$, denoted as $ex_G(v)$ is the maximum distance between $v$ and any other vertex of $G$

\textbf{Def: }let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. We set $C(G)$, called the \emph{center of $G$} as the set of vertices of $G$ with minimum eccentricity

\textbf{Proposition (5.2.1): }\emph{For any tree $T$, $C(T)$ has at most 2 vertices. If it has two vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$, then $\{ v_1, v_2 \}$ is an edge}\\


\textbf{Isomorphism Algorithm for Trees}

Two trees are isomorphic if and only if they have the same coding. The coding of $T$ is as follows
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{if $|C(T)| = 1$, then treat it as a rooted tree with $r \in C(T)$, and code appropriately}
    \item \emph{if $|C(T)| = 2$, then consider $T - e$. This generates two disconnected rooted trees with codes $A$ and $B$. Pick the code with the smaller lexographical ordering}
